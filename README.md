# Adaptive Correlation Optimization Networks (ACON)

## Overview
ACON is a new machine learning framework for maximum optimization and adaptability to diverse datasets. The framework automatically adapts its structure, learning rate, and loss function to optimize performance across various tasks and environments.

## Features
- **Adaptive Data Mapping:** Supports multiple dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE.
- **Hierarchical Correlation Modules:** Extracts and analyzes feature correlations dynamically.
- **Adaptive Optimization:** Includes SGD, Adam, and custom learning rate schedules.
- **Dynamic Loss Function:** Automatically switches between loss functions based on training progress.
- **Contextual Adaptation:** Adjusts model parameters based on environmental or task-specific contexts.
- **Meta-Learning:** Learns from past experiences to optimize future performance.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Integrates new data in real-time, ensuring the model stays up-to-date.

## Example Use Cases
- Time Series Analysis: Where data patterns and trends can change over time.
- Recommendation Systems: Where user preferences and item characteristics evolve.
- Anomaly Detection: Where identifying unusual patterns in data is crucial.
- Reinforcement Learning: Where agents need to adapt their behavior based on feedback from the environment.

## Installation
To install ACON, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
