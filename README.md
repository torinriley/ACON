# Adaptive Correlation Optimization Networks (ACON)

## Overview 
ACON is a new machine learning framework for maximum optimization and adaptability to diverse datasets. A sort of "Dataset Adaptability Toolbox for Machine Learning" is a framework that automatically adapts its structure, learning rate, and loss function to optimize performance across various tasks and environments.

ACON is particularly valuable for scenarios where adaptability, real-time learning, and contextual awareness are critical. It fills the gap left by more traditional, static frameworks by offering a flexible, responsive approach to machine learning that can handle the complexities of dynamic and evolving data. Suppose youâ€™re working in an environment where data is continuously changing, or where model performance needs to be optimized on the fly. In that case, ACON provides the tools to meet these challenges effectively and efficiently.


## Features
- **Adaptive Data Mapping:** Supports multiple dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE.
- **Hierarchical Correlation Modules:** Extracts and analyzes feature correlations dynamically.
- **Adaptive Optimization:** Includes SGD, Adam, and custom learning rate schedules.
- **Dynamic Loss Function:** Automatically switches between loss functions based on training progress.
- **Contextual Adaptation:** Adjusts model parameters based on environmental or task-specific contexts.
- **Meta-Learning:** Learns from past experiences to optimize future performance.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Integrates new data in real-time, ensuring the model stays up-to-date.
- **Adaptive Neural Architecture Search (ANAS):** Automatically discovers and optimizes the best neural network architecture tailored to your dataset for maximum performance.

A note on the Adaptive Neural Architecture Search (ANAS) Module: The ANAS module automatically discovers the optimal neural network architecture for your data by exploring and evaluating various model designs. It builds, trains, and validates multiple models, selecting the best-performing architecture tailored to your specific task. ANAS simplifies the complex process of neural network design, making advanced machine learning techniques accessible and efficient, all while optimizing performance for your unique dataset.

## Example Use Cases
- Time Series Analysis: Where data patterns and trends can change over time.
- Recommendation Systems: Where user preferences and item characteristics evolve.
- Anomaly Detection: Where identifying unusual patterns in data is crucial.
- Reinforcement Learning: Where agents need to adapt their behavior based on feedback from the environment.

## Installation
